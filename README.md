# amplicon_cov

Example of usage:

If we want to analyze coverage of samples in 'samples20210122_HY53JDRXX.tsv', with primers info in 'articV3primers.bed', while plotting and with verbose, outputting into '20210122out' (I think you need to create directory first): 

```python ./amplicon_covs.py -pv -s samples20210122_HY53JDRXX.tsv -r articV3primers.bed -o 20210122out/```
